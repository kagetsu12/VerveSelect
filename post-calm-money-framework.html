          <p>
            You don’t need a complicated spreadsheet to feel in control. You need a
            small set of clear buckets — and a rule for what goes where.
          </p>

              Money feels overwhelming when every decision has to be made from
              scratch. A calm framework moves most of those decisions into the
              background so you only need to check in, not constantly choose.
            </p>

            <h2>The three-bucket view</h2>
            <p>
              We like to think of everyday money in three buckets that stay the same
              no matter how much you earn:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Today</strong> – living costs and flexible spending.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Safety</strong> – cash buffers and essential insurance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Later</strong> – long‑term savings and investments.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each new dollar that comes in is gently directed into one of these
              buckets based on a simple percentage split you revisit once a year.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2>Insurance as a calm baseline, not a panic purchase</h2>
            <p>
              Instead of buying insurance after a scare, build it into your Safety
              bucket from the start. We prioritise:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Simple term life insurance for anyone who has dependants or shared
                financial commitments.
              </li>
              <li>
                Health insurance plans where out‑of‑pocket limits are clear and easy
                to understand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Renter’s or homeowner’s insurance that covers your actual lifestyle,
                not just the bare minimum.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              When we review insurance platforms and comparison tools, we focus on
              clarity and claims experience over aggressive discounts. Those
              findings live on our <a href="products.html">Reviews</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>Automate the boring parts</h2>
            <p>
              Wherever possible, move transfers to savings, investments, and
              insurance premiums into automatic payments. That way, “doing the right
              thing” with your money becomes the default, not an extra task on your
              list.
            </p>
            <p>
              A simple starting point is to align your automation with your pay
              schedule. On the day income arrives, have a fixed percentage move to
              your Safety bucket and another to Later, leaving the rest in Today.
              You can still make manual changes when life shifts, but the baseline
              continues quietly in the background.
            </p>
