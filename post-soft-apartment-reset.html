          <h1>A Soft Apartment Reset: Five Objects That Change the Room</h1>
          <p>
            You don’t have to move house to feel like you did. A few precise,
            tactile changes can turn a restless space into one that finally exhales.
          </p>
        </header>

        <div class="vs-article-cover">
          <img
            src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1571459/pexels-photo-1571459.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600"
            alt="Minimal living room with soft light, neutral sofa, and plants"

        </div>

          <div class="vs-article-main">
            <p>
              When clients tell us their homes feel “busy” or “unfinished”, they’re
              often picturing a full renovation. In reality, most small apartments
              only need a handful of well-considered objects to feel newly grounded.
            </p>

            <h2>Object 1: A weighty, neutral throw</h2>
            <p>
              Look for a throw that feels almost too heavy when you first pick it
              up. Draped over the back of a sofa or the end of a bed, it adds quiet
              visual depth and signals softness from across the room.
            </p>

            <div class="vs-article-cover" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
              <img
                src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/37347/bed-bedroom-clean-hotel-37347.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600"
                alt="Soft neutral bedding with a textured throw at the end of the bed"
              />
            </div>

            <h2>Object 2: A single sculptural lamp</h2>
            <p>
              Instead of spreading several small lamps around, pick one statement
              piece with a diffused shade. Place it where you actually spend time in
              the evenings — next to the sofa or by your reading chair — and keep it
              on a warm temperature setting.
            </p>

            <h2>Object 3: A low, calm coffee table</h2>
            <p>
              Coffee tables are often visual clutter magnets. A simple, low design
              with rounded corners naturally limits how much you can stack on top,
              and it subtly encourages you to keep only what you’re actively using:
              a book, a mug, maybe a small tray.
            </p>

            <h2>Platforms and pieces we like</h2>
            <p>
              For rental‑friendly furniture and decor, we regularly browse:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Independent makers on design marketplaces for sculptural lighting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Refurbished furniture platforms that resell solid wood pieces with
                life left in them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Direct‑to‑consumer brands that publish clear material breakdowns and
                care instructions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can find a shortlist of specific products and how they performed
              after a year of use on our <a href="products.html">Product Reviews</a>
              page.
            </p>

            <h2>Change just one corner first</h2>
            <p>
              If the whole room feels like too much, start with a single corner —
              the place where your eye lands first when you walk in. Once that area
              feels calm, you’ll know what the rest of the space needs to echo it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Give yourself a weekend morning to move pieces around without buying
              anything new. Try your heavy throw on a different chair, or swap the
              lamp from your desk to the bedside table. Often, the “new” feeling you
              are craving is already hiding in the objects you own — they just need
              a quieter layout to work harder for you.
            </p>
