          <h1>Skin Minimalism: A Three-Step Routine That Actually Works</h1>
          <p>
            The most underrated skincare step is editing. When you remove the noise,
            your skin finally has space to settle and repair itself.
          </p>
        </header>

              Many routines fail not because the products are bad, but because there
              are simply too many of them. Active ingredients overlap, your skin
              barrier is constantly asked to do more, and irritation slowly becomes
              your “new normal”.
            </p>

            <h2>The three steps we actually keep</h2>
            <p>For most people most of the time, you need only:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>A gentle cleanser</strong> that doesn’t leave your face
                feeling tight or squeaky.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A single active serum</strong> that targets your main
                concern.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A moisturiser with sunscreen in the morning</strong> and a
                slightly richer cream in the evening.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Everything else — mists, complicated exfoliants, multiple essences —
              can be added only once your skin feels calm for a few months in a
              row.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2>How to pick a serum that won’t overwhelm your skin</h2>
            <p>
              Instead of layering three or four different serums, pick one clear
              priority for the next 12 weeks: calming redness, smoothing texture, or
              softening fine lines.
            </p>
            <p>
              For redness and sensitivity, we tend to reach for serums with
              centella asiatica, panthenol, or oat extracts. If texture is your
              focus, a low‑percentage lactic acid or mandelic acid a few nights a
              week is often enough.
            </p>

            <h2>VerveSelect-tested minimalist staples</h2>
            <p>
              In our own bathrooms, we gravitate towards fragrance‑free, refillable
              options with straightforward INCI lists:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A milky gel cleanser that rinses clean without a separate makeup
                remover on light makeup days.
              </li>
              <li>
                A 0.3–0.5% retinol serum in an opaque pump bottle, used two nights a
                week and buffered with moisturiser.
              </li>
              <li>
                A moisturiser‑sunscreen hybrid with a soft, satin finish that
                doesn’t pill under makeup.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h2>Designing an evening routine that you actually keep</h2>
            <p>
              The most effective routines are the ones that fit inside your real
              life. Instead of aiming for a 45‑minute ritual every night, build a
              five‑minute baseline that you can run even when you are tired:
              cleanse, serum, moisturiser. Anything beyond that — masks, tools,
              extra eye products — becomes an optional upgrade for the nights when
              you have more energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep the products you use most at arm’s reach and in plain sight.
              Hiding everything in drawers might look tidy, but it also adds small
              bits of friction that make you more likely to skip steps. A shallow
              tray with just three or four bottles can still look minimal while
              inviting you to use them.
            </p>

            <h2>Let your barrier be boring</h2>
            <p>
              The most luxurious thing your skin can be is uneventful. When your
              routine is simple, you can actually tell what is and isn’t working.
              That feedback loop is far more valuable than any single “miracle”
              ingredient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Give your skin at least one full skin cycle — roughly four to six
              weeks — before judging whether this simplified routine “works”. Take
              photos in the same light at the beginning and end of that window. You
              may not notice slow, steady improvements in the mirror each morning,
              but the comparison will often tell a calmer, clearer story.
            </p>
