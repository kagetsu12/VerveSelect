          <p>
            A beautiful lobby photo isn’t enough. The right stay feels like a
            temporary home that takes things off your plate instead of adding more
            decisions.

              When you book a trip, you’re usually imagining how the destination
              will feel — not how the front desk will handle late check‑in, or
              whether the curtains actually block the streetlights at night. But
              these small details decide whether you come home restored or more
              tired than when you left.
            </p>

            <h2>Look for space, not square meters</h2>
            <p>
              On booking platforms, it’s tempting to prioritise room size. Instead,
              study the layout in the photos: Is there a clear surface to unpack on?
              Is the bed placed away from the door? Are there places to sit that
              aren’t just the bed?
            </p>

            <div class="vs-article-cover" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
              <img
                src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164595/pexels-photo-164595.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600"
                alt="Softly lit hotel lounge with neutral furniture and greenery"
              />
            </div>

            <h2>What we check on booking platforms</h2>
            <p>
              We regularly test three types of platforms for slow stays: direct
              hotel sites, curated booking platforms, and home‑style rentals. For
              each, we look for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Clear, recent photos of the exact room type you’re booking — not
                just “similar” imagery.
              </li>
              <li>
                Noise mentions in recent reviews, especially about hallways and
                neighbouring bars.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evidence of thoughtful basics: blackout curtains, firm mattresses,
                filtered water, and functional Wi‑Fi.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We keep a running list of consistently reliable platforms and
              independent properties. You’ll find those recommendations and notes on
              how they handled changes or delays on our
              <a href="products.html">Product & Platform Reviews</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>Under‑planning your itinerary on purpose</h2>
            <p>
              A slow stay is as much about what you don’t do. Leave a third of your
              days without fixed plans so you can stay longer at breakfast, wander a
              new neighbourhood twice, or simply go back to your room and nap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before you travel, list two or three non‑negotiables for the trip — a
              single museum, a walk you want to take, a restaurant you’re curious
              about. Let everything else be optional. When your hotel is chosen
              thoughtfully, unplanned hours spent in the room, lobby, or nearby
              streets can be just as nourishing as the “main” attractions.
